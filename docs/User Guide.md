------------------------------

###### This is a workspace view that binds scheme to a web view control.

The workspace typically displays three text panes and optional canvas.

- The larger pane is typically the expression evaluator; type expressions into this.
- The 2nd pane is typically the transcript; where printout goes.
- The result pane is the smaller pane that produces the expression result.

-----------

Enter "hello world" in the larger pane; and type control-return; the expression pane will display "hello world".

Enter (display "hello world") into the larger pane; and the type control-return the transcript pane will display hello world.

I like to keep the text to evaluate; the print out and the results; separate; hence the three panes.
